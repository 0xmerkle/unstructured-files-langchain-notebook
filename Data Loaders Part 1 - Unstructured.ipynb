      "[Document(page_content='Rihanna had the most effective commercial of the Super Bowl. About halfway into her halftime set (which attracted 119M viewers‚Äî6M more than the game), she touched up her make-up with her very own Fenty products. According to Launchmetrics, the stunt garnered Fenty $5.6M in earned media value within 12 hours.\\n\\nCommerce bleeds into every aspect of our lives. It‚Äôs there in the Super Bowl halftime show, sure, but it‚Äôs also the fuel powering the game: ~70 commercials, costing $7M for a 30-second spot, drive the NFL‚Äôs revenue from the game. (About 70% of Super Bowl ads are for alcohol, cars, and food.)\\n\\nWhile commerce has been around forever, its centrality in our lives is relatively new. One of the earliest recorded forms of commerce was cattle trade around 10,000 B.C. Cattle had a fixed value and were exchanged for goods and services. As a result, the Latin word for money, pecunia, comes from pecus, which is the Latin word for cattle.\\n\\nBut before the Industrial Revolution, product differentiation was limited. As a result, marketing in its modern form didn‚Äôt exist. Only with the automation of manufacturing‚Äîwhich unlocked the floodgates of production‚Äîdid it become essential to advertise products given consumers now had choice. The internet added accelerant to the fire, introducing new sales channels and the advent of digital advertising. Today, we‚Äôve come a long way from trading cows: commerce is a $26 trillion global market, and e-commerce comprises about $6 trillion of that.\\n\\nA year ago, I wrote Talking Shop: The Transformation of Commerce‚Äîa two-part deep-dive into 10 trends shaping commerce. It‚Äôs time for a refresh. This week and next, I‚Äôll cover 10 new trends:\\n\\nPower to the People\\n\\nGen Z Interns & Viral Marketing\\n\\nThe CAC Rules No Longer Apply\\n\\nInfluencer Commerce & Celebrity Brands\\n\\nSelf-Expression\\n\\nAI ü§ù Retail\\n\\nImmersive Shopping\\n\\nB2B Commerce Makes Life Easier\\n\\nSustainability\\n\\nDon‚Äôt Discount Discounters\\n\\nThis week, I‚Äôll cover #1-5. Next week, I‚Äôll tackle #6-10.\\n\\nLet‚Äôs dive in.\\n\\nOne of the challenges of online shopping is the omnipresence of dark patterns.\\n\\nA ‚Äúdark pattern‚Äù is a tactic used by a retailer to trick the consumer into doing something that benefits the retailer more than the consumer. Most retailers accomplish this with misleading web and app design. Examples include sneaking extra items into your cart, or using confusing language when you go to cancel an order‚Äî‚ÄúDo I click ‚ÄòCancel‚Äô or ‚ÄòOk‚Äô to complete cancellation?‚Äù ü§î\\n\\nA study by Merchant Machine found that Amazon‚Äîfamous for its customer obsession‚Äîis the worst culprit in retail, with 11 identified dark patterns. The most infuriating one that I consistently come across is the default to ‚ÄúSubscribe‚Äù to recurring purchases, versus complete a one-time purchase; here‚Äôs what it looks like when I go to order Whey protein:\\n\\nDark patterns may succeed in juicing short-term numbers, but over time they erode customer trust and tarnish a retailer‚Äôs reputation. One of my long-held beliefs about commerce‚Äîand about consumer-facing technology in general‚Äîis that power is always shifting to the customer. The arcs of technology and business bend toward customer-friendly products. This is especially true in today‚Äôs world of abundant consumer choice.\\n\\nAs a result, we‚Äôre seeing a shift to more products built to improve the customer experience rather than to get in the way. One example: loyalty programs. Starbucks just passed 30 million U.S. users in its rewards program, meaning that roughly 1 in 8 American adults is a member. (Fun fact: for many years, Starbucks was America‚Äôs leading mobile payments app‚Äîit now sits in second place behind Apple Pay, but still ahead of Google Pay.)\\n\\nLoyalty is key to driving customer lifetime value and to making a brand‚Äôs unit economics work. Nike‚Äôs loyalty members account for 70% of sales in new stores; Prime members spend 2.3x more on Amazon; Marriott loyalty members book 50% of rooms. Companies like Yotpo let retailers build customized rewards programs, offering a flexible infrastructure layer for loyalty.\\n\\nWe‚Äôre also seeing a newer generation of startups build with customers in mind:\\n\\nCatch, one of our portfolio companies at Index, cuts out credit card companies, letting shoppers pay by bank or debit. In return, shoppers earn 10% in store credit. As Catch puts it: ‚ÄúYou win. Brands win. Everyone wins except the credit card companies.‚Äù\\n\\nSafara, meanwhile, brings loyalty to hotels, offering a unified program across a million hotels that gives customers 10% back on every booking.\\n\\nAnd Beam, another company we work with at Index, embeds social impact into the checkout experience. Customers can donate 1% of their cart to a cause of their choice‚Äîsay, LGBTQ+ homelessness, ocean conservation, or school lunches for low-income kids. Importantly, it‚Äôs the brand giving up that 1%, not the customer. Shoppers get to shop their values, at no cost.\\n\\nCatch, Safara, and Beam are all built around delivering a better experience to the consumer. Their business models work because brands also win: average order values swell, conversion rates improve, retention ticks up. Incentives are aligned.\\n\\nEach is an example of a broader trend in commerce: power is shifting to the people, and the brands that win aren‚Äôt the brands that take advantage of the customer‚Äôs naivete, but the brands that deliver a more affordable, convenient, and enjoyable shopping experience.\\n\\n2) Gen Z Interns & Viral Marketing\\n\\nLast summer, 20-year-old Mary Clare Lacke interned at Claire‚Äôs, the teen accessories retailer that was once the go-to place for any 90s-baby looking to get her ears pierced. Claire‚Äôs revenue declined throughout the 2010s as the brand struggled to stay relevant in the digital age. One of Lacke‚Äôs tasks as an intern: inject fresh energy by running Claire‚Äôs nascent TikTok account.\\n\\nIn an 11-second video, Lacke riffed on a TikTok trend called ‚Äúkrissing‚Äù‚Äîa bait-and-switch type of video, inspired by Kris Jenner, that misleads the viewer and then reveals the fake-out. Lacke used #krissing to reveal that Claire‚Äôs did indeed still sell gummy bear earrings. The video generated 1.5 million views and 20,000 new followers for the company‚Äôs TikTok account.\\n\\nThis story speaks to a new phenomenon: the rise of the Gen Z TikTok intern.\\n\\nMary Claire Lacke is now one of four TikTok ‚Äúcollege creators‚Äù that work for Claire‚Äôs as interns during the school year, producing new TikTok videos each week. Other brands are following suit, leveraging young people‚Äôs digital fluency to stay relevant.\\n\\nThe payoffs can be immense: while a 30-second Super Bowl ad would have cost you $7 million, the 11-second Claire‚Äôs video reached millions (with much better targeting to boot), and likely cost just a few hours of hourly wages for a college intern.\\n\\nMastering social channels is crucial in today‚Äôs world. The Economist found that 50% of consumers have bought from a brand they recently discovered on social media.\\n\\nA recent McKinsey study takes things one step further: six in 10 Americans under 25 have actually completed a purchase on a social media site. Just this week, TikTok announced plans to move forward with its Shop feature, which gives brands the chance to sell products directly on the app with a full checkout experience.\\n\\nThe savviest brands consistently go viral: E.l.f. Cosmetics with its ‚ÄúEyes Lips Face‚Äù TikTok song; Chipotle with the Lid Flip Challenge; Wendy‚Äôs with its Twitter roasts. One of my favorite examples: the time Burger King announced it would offer 1-cent Whoppers to any smartphone user within 600 feet of a McDonald‚Äôs. Within a week, the campaign drove over 1M downloads of the Burger King app, and the app went from #400 to #1 on the App Store.\\n\\nIn last year‚Äôs Revisiting Lifetime Value and Customer Acquisition Cost, I wrote about some examples from Calm, one of the savviest marketers out there‚Äîsponsoring the anxiety-ridden 2020 Presidential Election coverage on CNN, for example, or covering Naomi Osaka‚Äôs fine for withdrawing from the French Open for her mental health. My favorite: Baa Baa Land (a riff on La La Land), an 8-hour film of sheep grazing in a field. The company marketed it as ‚Äúthe dullest movie ever‚Äù and promised it as the ultimate insomnia cure.\\n\\nSome companies even build virality into their features: Spotify Wrapped is a masterclass in viral marketing (in 2021, 60M users shared their Wrapped), while TikTok‚Äôs watermark and easy export features powered its ascent.\\n\\nFiguring out how to go viral and how to generate earned media value‚Äîeven if it requires hiring a Gen Z intern‚Äîis vital to survival as a brand in 2023. There‚Äôs more ‚Äúnoise‚Äù out there than ever before, and staying top-of-mind for consumers is a constant challenge. This is particularly true given what‚Äôs happening with customer acquisition costs.\\n\\n3) The CAC Rules No Longer Apply\\n\\nApple‚Äôs App Tracking Transparency (ATT) changes have created something of a recession in digital advertising. The major ad platforms‚ÄîGoogle, YouTube, Snap, Meta, etc.‚Äîare seeing slowing or even negative ad revenue growth. Digital real estate was finite to begin with, and supply-demand imbalances made sure that ad prices were steadily creeping up throughout the 2010s. Now, it‚Äôs harder than ever to measure those ads or ensure ROI. The old adage goes, ‚ÄúHalf my advertising spend is wasted; the trouble is, I don‚Äôt know which half.‚Äù In a post-ATT world, this takes on new meaning.\\n\\nI covered ATT in more detail in last year‚Äôs CAC: Customer Acquisition Chaos, and one of the best recent pieces breaking it down is Eric Seufert‚Äôs ATT Recession. The deterioration of direct response advertising may be the biggest shift in retail right now, as every brand faces CAC headwinds. Some enterprising startups are lessening the hurt. Northbeam and Triple Whale, for instance, are ad attribution platforms that help media buyers understand how their ad spend is performing‚Äîsomething that‚Äôs much more difficult in 2023 than in recent years.\\n\\nWe‚Äôre also seeing creative new channels emerge. Earlier this month, we announced our investment in Flagship, which lets creators launch their own boutique storefronts that showcase their favorite products. Brands are drawn to Flagship because they pay $0 unless someone converts; when someone buys, they‚Äôre happy to give up a percent of the sale because they just acquired a new customer. Flagship boutiques are a new, scalable channel for brands to explore.\\n\\nAnother example of a new acquisition channel: short-term rentals. Minoan is a startup that lets property managers buy brands for their rental units, where hundreds or thousands of annual visitors will experience the product‚Äîsay, a Casper mattress, a Fellow coffee grinder, or a West Elm accent chair. Brands clamor to offer property managers discounted goods, because they want to be front-and-center for prospective new customers. In a world with more digital nomads, short-term rentals could become the newest form of experiential retail.\\n\\nAs CACs steadily creep up, brands have to get more creative about how to refine and measure their ad spend, and about how to reach customers through new channels.\\n\\n4) Influencer Commerce & Celebrity Brands\\n\\nWith CACs rising, brands with built-in distribution are well-positioned. In other words, celebrity brands.\\n\\nI recently got into an argument with a friend about celebrity brands. Inferior celebrity products, he argued, would beat out better products by leveraging free distribution‚Äî say, a massive Instagram following. I countered that consumers are savvy, and poorly-executed celebrity brands don‚Äôt stand a chance. I stand by that.\\n\\nThere‚Äôs a growing graveyard of celebrity brands that failed to catch on; people can sniff out inauthenticity and low effort. Most struggling celebrity brands are silently sunsetted, with a celebrity gradually posting less and less about her brand.\\n\\nEven big celebs struggle: the WSJ recently reported that BeyonceÃÅ‚Äôs partnership with Adidas, the clothing brand Ivy Park, saw its sales fall 50% last year. Adidas projected $250M in 2022 sales, but the brand only brought in $40M. Ouch. Ivy Park is now set to lose about $200M for Adidas this year. (My take is that BeyonceÃÅ‚Äôs aspirational, somewhat-aloof persona is at odds with Ivy Park‚Äôs athleisure style. She should have created an ultra-luxury brand.)\\n\\nThe celebrity brands that endure do three things right: 1) They‚Äôre authentic to the celebrity, 2) They have a genuinely unique insight, and 3) They move beyond the celeb figurehead. The two most successful examples, in my mind, are Rihanna‚Äôs Fenty and Kim Kardashian‚Äôs SKIMS. Their unique insights:\\n\\nFenty: Make-up should come in more shades for people of color.\\n\\nSKIMS: Shapewear is outerwear.\\n\\nBoth are raking in hundreds of millions, if not billions in revenue. They injected new energy into stale categories.\\n\\nBoth brands have also elevated themselves beyond Rihanna and Kim. SKIMS marketing, for instance, now rarely features Kim herself; the company brilliantly tapped Mia and Lucia from White Lotus Season 2 for its Valentine‚Äôs Day campaign, at the exact moment the two women were embedded in the zeitgeist ü§å\\n\\nThe danger facing celebrity brands is to be too closely associated with the celebrity. Kylie Jenner‚Äôs Kylie Cosmetics saw sales fall ~50% when Kylie took a break from posting to Instagram during her pregnancy. And this year, Adidas is set to lose $1.3 billion (!) from Yeezy after Kanye West‚Äôs self-destruction.\\n\\nI tend to be more optimistic about celebrities and influencers as brand curators than as brand creators. Only a select few can build enduring de novo brands. But millions can be arbiters of taste, recommending to their communities what to buy. This is the thinking behind Flagship, mentioned above in the CAC section. Flagship‚Äôs business model is designed so that creators do what they do best‚Äîoffer trusted recommendations:\\n\\nThe 800-pound gorilla in this category is still LTK (formerly LIKEtoKNOW.it), which just announced that it has a roster of 200,000 influencers driving $3.6B in annual GMV. The company boasts that 200 creators have made over $1M through affiliate on LTK.\\n\\nOne of the longest-running shifts in consumer behavior is trust migrating from corporations to people. Many shoppers would rather buy MrBeast Burger over McDonald‚Äôs, George Clooney‚Äôs Casamigos over Don Julio, Logan Paul‚Äôs Prime over Gatorade. We see this shift both in the rise of celebrity brands, though few have staying power, and in the long-tail curation of the influencer ecosystem.\\n\\n5) Self-Expression\\n\\nOne of the biggest behavior shifts in Gen Z is a shift to more self-expression.\\n\\nOne interesting way this is revealing itself: weddings. The oldest members are Gen Z are 25, and they‚Äôre beginning to get married. A report last week found that a third of couples are choosing a wedding theme, up from 13% in 2017‚Äîexamples include ‚ÄúTaylor Swift and Cats,‚Äù ‚ÄúRoaring ‚Äò20s with Star Wars influence,‚Äù and ‚ÄúVintage Nintendo.‚Äù And 40% of couples choose signature cocktails, compared with just 17% in 2017. (One thing that hasn‚Äôt changed: Ed Sheeran‚Äôs ‚ÄúPerfect‚Äù reigns as the most-chosen first dance song for the sixth straight year.)\\n\\nWe also see self-expression in the phenomenon of ‚Äúcommitting to the bit.‚Äù Committing to the bit basically entails ironic consumption. In a piece in The Atlantic last week, Michael Waters told the story of 27-year-old Adonna Biel. Biel isn‚Äôt even a Pitbull fan, but she and her coworkers thought it would be funny to go to a Pitbull concert. So they committed to the bit: they rented a car they called the ‚ÄúPitbus,‚Äù they bought Pitbull merch, and they even wore bald caps (Pitbull is famously bald). As a very casual Katy Perry fan who flew to Vegas last year dressed as a plastic bag, committing to the bit resonates with me.\\n\\nCommitting to the bit is a way of sampling identities, of trying on new forms of self-expression. Waters asks, ‚ÄúIf committing to the bit means exploring the contours of a new persona, then perhaps it starts with a curiosity: What would it feel like to be that person for a day?‚Äù\\n\\nMany Gen Z-focused brands say something specific about your personality: Madhappy means you value mental health; Dolls Kill means you‚Äôre edgy; Nensi Dojaka means you‚Äôre a ‚Äúcool girl.‚Äù Expressing personality through clothes is nothing new, of course‚Äîbut the torrid pace with which young people embrace and discard both their clothes and their identities is new.\\n\\nThis is made possible by secondhand marketplaces. You can try one aesthetic, then sell those clothes on Vinted when you tire of them.\\n\\nOr you can turn to even nicher marketplaces‚ÄîCoscove, for instance, is a marketplace for cosplay costumes. Cosplay (a portmanteau of ‚Äúcostume‚Äù and ‚Äúplay‚Äù) is booming: one report estimated the cosplay costumes market to be $4.6 billion in 2020, growing to $23 billion by 2030, a 17.4% annualized growth rate. The tailwind? Self-expression.\\n\\nOne stat that surprised me: a Bain report found that the average Gen Z shopper makes their first luxury purchase when they‚Äôre 15, compared with 19 for their 30-something counterparts. Part of this embrace of luxury likely stems from the desire to use those products to achieve status or belonging. Part also comes from the fact that they can easily resell those goods on the internet, and move on to buy the next thing.\\n\\nFinal Thoughts: The Fusion of Offline & Online\\n\\nIf there‚Äôs one overarching trend of commerce in the 21st century, it‚Äôs the fusion of offline retail and online retail. The holy grail for a brand is to merge atoms and bits, building relationships with customers in both the physical and digital worlds.\\n\\nThe most pioneering brands find new ways to do so. Nike, for example, allows buyers to design sneakers on its website, and then pick them up in-store. Glossier began as a direct-to-consumer e-commerce brand, but is now launching its much-hyped, stunning Soho flagship‚Äîand more importantly, you can now buy Glossier products in Sephora. Omnichannel is the future.\\n\\nFor the first time since 2016, physical store openings exceeded closings in 2022. And this year, retailers plan to open 3x more stores than they close, as pandemic-driven hesitations around brick-and-mortar give way. Shoppers clearly want a tight tether between online and offline.\\n\\nMany of the companies mentioned in this piece are B2C‚ÄîSKIMS and Vinted, for instance. But even more are B2B‚ÄîCatch and Beam, Flagship and Minoan, Northbeam and Triple Whale. They power a new infrastructure for an omnichannel, technology-infused retail revolution.\\n\\nWhat‚Äôs fascinating about the retail landscape is how rapidly the consumer experience is evolving. Shopping in 2023 looks very different than shopping in 2013‚Äîand shopping in 2033 will likewise stand in stark contrast to shopping today.\\n\\nNext week, I‚Äôll cover #6 through #10:\\n\\nAI ü§ù Retail\\n\\nImmersive Shopping\\n\\nB2B Commerce Makes Life Easier\\n\\nSustainability\\n\\nDon‚Äôt Discount Discounters\\n\\nUntil then üëã', lookup_str='', metadata={'source': './data/rex-woodbury-substacks/retail_revolution.txt'}, lookup_index=0)]\n"

      " A recent McKinsey study has found that 60% of Americans under 25 have made a purchase on a social media site. TikTok has recently announced plans to launch Shop, an in-app feature that will enable brands to sell products directly with a complete checkout experience.\n",
      "\n",
      " Burger King achieved a successful viral campaign by offering 1-cent Whoppers to any smartphone user within 600 feet of a McDonald's, resulting in over 1 million downloads of the Burger King app and propelling the app to the #1 spot on the App Store in a week's time. This exemplifies how savvy brands, such as E.l.f. Cosmetics, Chipotle and Wendy's, are able to go viral.\n",

      "Calm, known for its savvy marketing, sponsored the 2020 Presidential Election coverage on CNN and supported Naomi Osaka's fine for withdrawing from the French Open for her mental health. An example of their creativity is Baa Baa Land, a 8-hour film of sheep grazing in a field marketed as \"the dullest movie ever\".\n",

      " A promise is made that a cure for insomnia has been found.\n",

      " Companies have begun to incorporate viral marketing features into their products and services. Spotify Wrapped has been a successful example, with 60M users sharing their Wrapped in 2021, while TikTok's watermark and export features have been key to its rapid rise in popularity.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2023, success as a brand will depend on the ability to go viral and generate earned media value. With more competition than ever before, it is crucial to stay top-of-mind for customers. This is especially difficult given the changes in customer acquisition costs. Hiring a Gen Z intern may be necessary to accomplish this.\n",
      "\n",
      " App Tracking Transparency changes implemented by Apple have caused a decline in digital advertising revenue growth for major ad platforms such as Google, YouTube, and Snap. These changes have made it difficult to measure the success of ads and ensure return on investment. The current ad climate is challenging, with a finite supply of digital real estate and an increasing demand.\n",
      "\n",
      " This statement, originally made by American business executive John Wanamaker, suggests that much of the money spent on advertising is wasted, and this is only further complicated due to the impact of the AT&T ruling.\n",
      "\n",
      " Last year's CAC: Customer Acquisition Chaos covered ATT in detail and Eric Seufert's ATT Recession provides a good overview of the current situation. Direct response advertising is decreasing, leading to higher customer acquisition costs (CAC) for brands. Startups such Northbeam and Triple Whale are helping media buyers by providing ad attribution platforms to understand their ad spend.\n",

      "Flagship, a recently-invested-in company, allows creators to launch boutique storefronts to showcase their favorite products. Brands that use Flagship only pay if a customer converts - and they are willing to pay a percentage of the sale, as they are gaining a new customer. Flagship boutiques are a new, scalable channel for brands to use.\n",
      "\n",
      " Minoan is a startup that offers property managers discounted goods from popular brands like Casper, Fellow, and West Elm in exchange for renters experiencing the product. This is a new acquisition channel for brands to gain customers in the digital nomad world.\n",
      "\n",
      " Short-term rentals are being proposed as an innovative new form of retail experience.\n",
      "\n",
      " As CACs (customer acquisition costs) increase, brands must become more creative in terms of how they refine and measure their ad spend, as well as how they reach their customers through new channels. This is especially beneficial for celebrity brands that have built-in distribution.\n",
      "\n",
      " A discussion took place between two friends about celebrity brands and whether inferior products could overpower better ones with the help of free distribution like a large Instagram following. The speaker argued that consumers are smart and bad celebrity brands won't be successful. The speaker's opinion remains unchanged.\n",
      "\n",
      " Many celebrity brands have failed due to lack of authenticity and effort, leading to them being quietly discontinued. As a result, celebrities are no longer promoting their brands as much.\n",
      "\n",
      " BeyonceÃÅ's partnership with Adidas, Ivy Park, saw a 50% fall in sales last year, resulting in $200M of losses for Adidas. It is suggested that her persona may be at odds with the athleisure style of the brand, and that she should have created an ultra-luxury brand.\n",
      "\n",
      " Celebrities with enduring brands do three things correctly: authenticity, unique insight, and go beyond the celeb figurehead. Two of the most successful are Rihanna's Fenty and Kim Kardashian's SKIMS. Fenty's unique insight is make-up should come in more shades for people of color while SKIMS' is shapewear is outerwear.\n",
      "\n",
      " Two companies are generating significant revenues, revitalizing stagnant categories.\n",
      "\n",
      " SKIMS and Fenty have both moved past using Rihanna and Kim for their marketing campaigns, instead relying on influencers like Mia and Lucia from White Lotus Season 2 to promote their Valentine's Day campaign.\n",
      "\n",
      " Sales of Kylie Jenner's Kylie Cosmetics dropped significantly when she took a break from social media during her pregnancy, and Adidas is expected to lose a large sum this year due to Kanye West's behavior. This emphasizes the danger of relying too heavily on celebrity branding.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "Flagship's business model allows celebrities and influencers to become brand curators rather than brand creators, allowing them to offer trusted recommendations to their communities on what to buy. This model has been successful in allowing the select few to create enduring de novo brands.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Consumer trust is gradually shifting away from corporations and towards individuals, reflected in the rise of celebrity brands and influencer-led curation. This can be seen in the recent success of products such as MrBeast Burger, George Clooney's Casamigos, and Logan Paul's Prime, which have surpassed more established brands like McDonald's, Don Julio, and Gatorade.\n",
      "\n",
      " Gen Z is characterized by a strong emphasis on self-expression.\n",
      "\n",
      " Gen Z couples are increasingly choosing unique and creative wedding themes, such as \"Taylor Swift and Cats,\" and incorporating signature cocktails into their special day. These trends have seen an increase from 2017 and are a reflection of Gen Z's creative and individualistic approach to their weddings. Despite these changes, Ed Sheeran's \"Perfect\" remains a popular wedding song.\n",

      "Committing to the bit is a phenomenon of ironic consumption, as seen in the story of Adonna Biel and her coworkers who went to a Pitbull concert despite not being fans of his music. They committed to the bit by renting a car they called the \"Pitbus\", buying Pitbull merch, and even wearing bald caps.\n",

      "\n",

      "Committing to the bit is a way of exploring new identities and self-expression, starting with a curiosity about what it would be like to take on a new persona for a day.\n",
      "\n",
      " Gen Z-focused brands have a unique way of expressing a person's identity through clothing. Young people are increasingly embracing and discarding both their clothes and identities at a fast rate, which is something new.\n",
      "\n",
      " Secondhand marketplaces, such as Vinted, allow users to experiment with different aesthetics by buying and selling used clothing.\n",
      "\n",
      " Cosplay, a combination of \"costume\" and \"play\", is a rapidly growing market estimated to reach $23 billion by 2030 due to its popularity for self-expression. Coscove is an example of a marketplace that specializes in cosplay costumes.\n",
      "\n",
      " The average Gen Z shopper makes their first luxury purchase at 15, which is younger than the 30-something counterparts. This can be attributed to the desire for status and the ability to resell luxury items on the internet.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

Nike allows customers to design their own sneakers online and pick them up in-store, while Glossier has gone from a direct-to-consumer e-commerce brand to launching a flagship store and being sold in Sephora. Omnichannel shopping is the future of retail.\n",
